## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Usability Implication

My website is very easy to navigate and for the user to control what they want their site to store/display. My website easily allows the user to get around without instructions and its up to them to what they want and where they want it. The user has the options of checkboxes, delete buttons, drop down menus and the home button to help navigate and control their webpage. I added these to ensure the user could do the main things they know or expect to have control over when using a webpage like this. The project has been impacted with this implication with the use of an easy navigation and the user knowing what to do based on what they want out of it. My website is built on being easily navigation wise to get around and know what you want it to look like through priority and subjects.



### Functionality Implication

My webpage has really suceeded in this as it is built to function by being able to add, delete, check off and list all the users subjects and assessments however they want. I have given them the tools to make the website look the way they want and gave them the feeling of freedom when using the page.


### Aesthetic Implication

My webpage has met this implication quite well as my webpage displays nicely with certain information sticking out to the users like the due dates when next to the assessments and the priority numbers too. I wanted those specific bit of information to stick out to allow easy viewing and make sure the user knows immediatly whats going on with it catching their eyes. The colors are a nice choice too as there are no blinding lights or off colors that don't fit. It all blends together giving it a nice calm tone. The borders around also make it look nice and not all cramed together. 


### End-User Implication

Throughout my webpage building I have been really using my end-user to help guide me through what they think my webpage should look like and work like for us both. Whenever I thought an idea or look wasn't good or I wasn't sure, my end-user would give me feedback on what I could improve on or leave. The feedback was usually exactly what I wanted to hear. This allowed my webpage to develop not just to one I would like, but one that another person with similar ideas would like to see in a webpage. I also took on feedback on what a "final design" would look like. If it wasn't all positive, I would change the page until it was.


### Accessibility Implication

The good thing about my website is that it doesn't have to be limited to just one group of people. It can spread to a whole range. People in full time work could use this to track tasks for certain areas of work. They can track meetings and business opportunities. I built the website yes around school kids and people stacked on work for school. But it can be accessible to anyone at anytime. They can track anything to allow somewhere to go to ensure they have finished what they sought out to do. Having this website available to any one of any age or for any need is relevant as it does work for any of those areas. Being able to store information for your work or schooling is a great need to make the website helpful. Being able to set up core groups to store the specific work in each one. Then having the option to delete or tick off each one you want.

## Overall Review

Replace these words with a brief review of how the project went in terms of:
- What went well? - The website and building it all together. The core of what I wanted.
- What didn't go so well? - Trying to setup these ideas for all different areas of my page alone. Needing help to separate the assessment and subject code to make sure they only work for each other.
- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system? - I was able to see change and progress I was making to my webpage. I could try many things to see what worked better and if I wasn't sure about something I could always do more testing to improve on it.
- What would you do differently if you could? - More design to the website. I did have an idea of adding a progress bar. I did have it displaying in the home page but at the last minute I realised how hard it'd be to implement, so I left it. I would do this to show the user and give thm the positive feeling of completing tasks in an orderly fasion.
