# Sprint 3 - A Refined and Complete System


## Sprint Goals

Develop the system until it is fully featured, with a refined UI and it satisfies the requirements. The system will be fully tested at this point.


---

## Updated Database Schema (if it changed)

The Homework Tracker will be a website where you can create a base subject with teacher and priority of the subject to your studies. Then in each subject you can add work and assessments that you want to track to complete. Being able to display them by priority and add their due dates too!

The web app is fully implemented with a refined UI:

## Priority Design

Currently my subjects and assessments have a priority displayed on the left to let them know where their subjects sit from most important to not so important. The problem is they look ugly. So I want to fix the look to have a border look and pop out vs what they currently look like.

### Changes / Improvements

I have now added a nice border and bold look to the text to make the priority stand out and look nice with the subjects.

## Body Color

I want my webpage to have a color that separates the body from the drop down menu and the list of subjects/assessments. So I will try some colors and implement them into what my website will look like.

### Changes / Improvements

I got my website to have a nice grey color of #222. It really blends well with the white drop-down menu and list and for now suits the website.

## Subjects/Assessments List Layout

Right now the list layouts for the subjects/assessments is too cramped and looks horrible. So, as agreed with my end-user, I want to separate them, clearly to our eyes that they look quite nice.

### Changes / Improvements

I managed to give each subject/assessment enough space in between each other making them display quite nicely on the page. Giving nice margins between each one makes it look clean.

## List Hovering

Right now the websites lists or buttons don't move or change color when you hover over them. So... pretty boring. What I want to do is start with the lists. Making them try and move when you hover over top. End-user agrees.

### Changes / Improvements

The websites lists now successfully move when you hover over top. Showing it recognizes you are scanning over top. Looks great too.

## Checkboxes Display Color and Hover

I want my checkboxes to do 2 things now. Look different color wise and when hovered over I want the color to change slightly, showing the user they are scanning over an option. End-user agrees with choice for checkboxes as they do look pretty boring right now.

![Alt text](<screenshots/Sprint-3/Checkboxes Display Color and Hover Initial.gif>)

### Changes / Improvements

The checkboxes now display a purple like color and when hovered over they show a little different to their idle look, showing a sign the user scanning over them.

## Date Color and Hover

I want the same with the checkboxes where the date has a new color for the background of the text and when hovered it changes a color slightly to signal to the user they are scanning over the dates.

![Alt text](<screenshots/Sprint-3/Date Color and Hover Initial.gif>)

### Changes / Improvements

I made the color for the due date a nice grey making it actually stand out quite nicely. Then having a hover to make it change color when scanned over with mouse.
