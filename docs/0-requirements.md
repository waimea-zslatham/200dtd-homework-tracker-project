# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

Students at high school generally can have problems remembering their work they have to keep on top of. With assessments and work that piles up, having an app that stores it all will be so useful for kids our age.


## End-User Requirements

Typical End-Users for this would be high schoolers with subjects that have assessments. This can also be used by adults with jobs too. They have the ability to put down work of their specific needs to keep track. They will be expecting for it all to work and there to be no issues with writing up work.
