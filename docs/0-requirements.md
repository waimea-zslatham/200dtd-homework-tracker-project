# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

Students at high school generally can have problems remembering their work they have to keep on top of. With assessments and work that piles up, having an app that stores it all will be so useful for kids our age.


## End-User Requirements

Typical End-Users for this would be high schoolers with subjects that have assessments. This can also be used by adults with jobs too. They have the ability to put down work of their specific needs to keep track. They will be expecting for it all to work and there to be no issues with writing up work.


## Proposed Solution

A website that can take all the info you want to put on your assessments you are keeping track of. Being able to access the site on the go so if you need to put down information on a phone or desktop you can.

# Relevant Implications

## Usability Implications

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

### Relevance to the System

My website will be easy to navigate and for the user to control what they want their site to store/display. So the specific work for subjects will be up to the user to put where they want. There is no need for instructions to get around and its up to them to what they want and where they want it.

### Impact / Considerations

I will consider making a checklist box so the user can check off assignments for each subject but have an option to delete too. So if they are doing the work one day then another they can keep track of if its done but not finished. The project will be impacted with this implication with the use of an easy navigation and the user knowing what to do based on what they want out of it.



## Functionality Implications

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

### Relevance to the System

Its relevant to the system as it will provide the intended purpose of being able to store information the user wants to store for specific subjects of work.

### Impact / Considerations

It will follow with what needs to be done and displayed to allow the user to use it the way they want and put their information up the way they want.



## Aesthetic Implications

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is related to my project as my website will have a designed layout to make it look nice and readable. It will have colors that will be easy to look at for all ages.

### Impact / Considerations

I will consider different colors to display menus separated from the page. Using colors for texts that fit the background and making sure they all display nicely together.



## End-User Implications

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s)

### Relevance to the System

It will allow me to take on feedback to make my website better and use feedback and criticism to help make it what other users will also want/like

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to take on feedback every time I make a change to ensure the change is actually a good decision. I can then get new and more ideas to make my website better. I will need to consider multiple peoples feedback for my website to get the similar ideas from everyone.


## Accessibility Implications

The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) involve ensuring it is available to, and can be used by, all end-users, regardless of their abilities.

### Relevance to the System

Having this website available to any one of any age or for any need is relevant as it will work for any of those areas. Being able to store information for your work or schooling is a great need to make the website helpful. Being able to set up core groups to store the specific work in each one. Then having the option to delete or tick off each one you want.

### Impact / Considerations

I will want to consider to not display information telling the user what they could put for a specific group. Eg, put subjects then assessments in each one. As it sounds like I'm limiting the thought that only school users will use my site. When anyone from actual jobs could.
