# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## UI 'Flow' (Homework Tracker V1)

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

### Testing
I got feedback from Liam and LeBron on changes to make my website better on what they personally think.
>(Liam) Need to be able to go in and also remove the subject.

>Want to see it demonstrated as a phone screen to get a sense of where everything would be on it.

>(LeBron) Give a list of what work is in each assessment.

### Changes / Improvements

From this I changed things around to fit what they think would make my website a lot better. Adding work to each assessment and made it be seen as a phone screen. I also put as an option to remove subjects too with a screen for it. This can be seen in V2.

## Initial UI Prototype (Homework Tracker V2)

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

### Testing

For this I used the feedback from V1 to make my website better. I got overall positive feedback but also some feedback on what they think can make it overall really good.
>(Liam) Colors are off and simple. Use some darker colors

>(Taine) Good idea to add Due Dates/Deadlines for each assessment that the user can customize.

>(Caius) Display priority of each assessment and subject.

## Refined UI Prototype (Homework Tracker V3)

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.
