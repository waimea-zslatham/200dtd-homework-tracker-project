# Database-Connected Website Project - Some ideas to get you thinking...

## Requirements

- Provides useful functionality
- Connects to a DB and queries it to access data
- Data presented in an attractive and accessible way
- Modifies data in the DB (i.e. new data added)
- Database has two or more related tables
- Site is very well designed (good use of design principles)
- UI for functionality is intuitive and pleasant to use

## Real Need / Client

The key to a successful project is to come up with an idea based around a genuine need. Even better, find someone who has that need - they can help you with ideas, testing, feedback, etc.

Don’t just make a website about bikes because you like bikes. Find someone who works with bikes and who has a need... So maybe a bike shop needs a way to keep track of customers and their bikes when they are brought in form a service... That’s the need, and from that the database and website will naturally flow... You don’t have to make up some fake reason for creating the system.

## Types of Functionality

A suitable level of complexity for a Level 2 project might involve the following functionality:

- **Ordering**: Accessing a catalogue of products, compiling an order
- **Storage**: Storing data of some kind that is categorised
- **Scoring**: Processing data input for a sport / event
- **Stock Management**: Access to information about large collections of objects
- **Communication**: Allowing conversations between users
- **Connections**: Connecting users via some sort of profile data

## Some Ideas

These are to get you *thinking* about the sort of areas you could be looking at, the people you could be talking to and the types of conversations you might be having so that you can identify a **genuine need / problem to solve**:

### Ordering
- The need to track orders / clients
- The need to configure / customise a complex product / system / service

### Organisation
- The need to track / save URLs
- The need to save / lookup passwords for sites / services
- The need to keep track of homework
- The need to plan things (e.g. lessons, projects)
- The need to keep track of household tasks (e.g. chores, meals, etc.)

### Resource Management
- The need to track the levels of stock in a store / organization
- The need to allocate a limited resource (e.g. time, rooms, people)

### Scoring / Stats
- The need to record and process scores for a club / league / team / player
- The need tp record and process scores for event
- The need for individuals to track personal performance

### Communication
- The need to share personal ideas / information for others to read
- The need for groups of people to post info regarding a topic / club / team

### Connections
- The need to match people with others (e.g. for activities)
