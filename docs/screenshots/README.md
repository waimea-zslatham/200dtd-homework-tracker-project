# Screenshots Folder

Any screenshots / animated GIFs / other media files should be named:
- **Without spaces in the file name**
- Ideally with **short** filenames that describe what is being shown

Then, you can use this in your docs using Markdown image syntax, referencing the screenshots folder:

```markdown
![](screenshots/filename.gif)
```
