## Project Description

My project will be a Homework Tracker. The user will have the option of adding subjects or activities on the main home page. Then in each subject there will be an option
to add homework or assignments for each one. You can order them by priority in a list and you can check off if each assessment is done in each one and on the home page
if the subjects work is all completed.

## Project Details

This is a digital media and database project for **NCEA Level 2**, assessed against standards [91892](docs/as91892.pdf) and [91893](docs/as91892.pdf).

The project is a web app that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) for the server back-end, connecting to a SQLite database. The final deployment of the app is on [Render](https://render.com/), with the database hosted at [Turso](https://turso.tech/).

The app uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) templating for structuring pages and data, and [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) as the starting point for styling the web front-end.

The project demonstrates a number of **advanced database techniques**:
- Linking data in related tables or nodes using queries or keys
- Writing custom queries to filter and/or sort data
- Using logical, mathematical and/or wildcard operators
- Customising presentation of the data
- Using custom forms to add user input to the database
- Setting validation rules for data entry

The project demonstrates a number of **advanced digital media (web) techniques**:
- Creating or customising scripts, code or presets
- Using a combination of steps to manipulate or enhance elements
- Using a third-party library
- Using composite effects
